Approach AoA is a guess, giving something around half the wing's critical AoA. In reality, with full or near-full flaps it's probably significantly more shallow than this. (See wing notes below.)
I don't really know what the top speed of the Optica is with the IO-540; the original Optica used a 150 HP engine giving anemic performance. Production models used 260 or 300 HP engines. The plane was meant for slow and efficient cruise speeds but I know from one flight test report that it could be pushed to Vne. Therefore I use Vne as the top-end.

Cabin, an approximation for a duct body for drag, and two booms. Duct width is based on the duct as a torus, using an area based on that of a circle of the outer diameter minus a circle of the inner diameter, and calculating an effective diameter (0.73) based on the result. It's likely a bad guesstimation and its moment will be too small, but better than nothing.

Wing:
I have no numbers for incidence, so I'm using 0. Given the already good view forward, it probably wouldn't need much if any incidence. Also, since the airfoil has such a high lift factor, fast cruise has a significant nose-down attitude which would be exaggerated by incidence.
I have no numbers for twist, so using a generic -3 degrees.
The model uses an older wingtip design. Later versions appear to use a modified Horner tip, which I may re-model in the future. The tips might give a few more inches of effective span due to lateral vortex displacement etc., but I currently don't account for that.
Flaps over 10 deg serve to increase the Optica's angle of descent, ie, bring the nose down for approach. Total full-flap pitch-down should be about 11 degrees from 10 deg flaps to 50 deg flaps. It's difficult to achieve this because YASim does not allow positioning the effects of flap lift/drag or modifying Cm. With no flaps, the sink-rate at 70 kts should be 500 ft/min. With full flaps, this becomes 900 ft/min. Flap drag was set to get something like these numbers, but the FDM has been through many changes since I last flight tested for sink rate so I'm not sure how it fares now.
The airfoil is a GA(W)-1 meant for low-speed, high-lift applications, with a Cl at 0 alpha of about 0.4, 0 Cl at -4.5 alpha, and a Clmax of about 1.6, giving a YASim camber of ~0.25. Max lift occurs at about 16 degrees. Stall should be very gentle and mushy with little tendency to drop a wing, so I set a fairly wide width.

Nothing fancy here. Camber adjusted to help achieve a reasonable tail incidence. Elevator lift is heavier than I would usually advocate, but since the payload is far forward compared to the CG it needs a strong positive response for the variety of loads.

The real Optica is very sensitive to weight and balance. Single-pilot operation requires significant ballast in the nose. In many photos there appears to be a rack of weights fitted just forward of the instrumentation pylon. The tailbooms contain an adjustable sliding weight that can fine-tune balance on the ground. This should be reflected by a change in ballast position, but currently YASim doesn't support property-driven ballast, so I'm using a weight.
